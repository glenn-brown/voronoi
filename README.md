Voronoi Graph library for Go
============================

This code implements a library to perform Fortune's algorithm on a set of
points, returning Voronoi edges which can be used to construct tiling polygons.

This implementation is heavily based off of Ivan Kuckir's writeup and code,
which is available from:
